# Design_and_Verification_of_APB_RAM_SV
Designed AMBA APB protocol in the form of APB RAM using System Verilog. Verification environment is created with generator,driver,monitor,scoreboard etc., to verify the APB RAM using CRT in System Verilog. The simulation is performed on Aldec Riviera Pro 2022.04 simulator and test results are analysed to check functional correctness of the design.
